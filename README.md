===================================

[https://michurin.github.io/fast-online-mandelbrot-set-explorer/](https://michurin.github.io/fast-online-mandelbrot-set-explorer/)

Status
------

Just for fun project. It's not totally finished.

Limitations
-----------

This solution is based on WebGL. So, it doesn't work in old browsers and hardware.

Motivation
----------

There are a lot of Mandelbrot exploring project, that are focused on
palette selection and beautiful result.
The goal of the project, in contrast, is to create online
fast Mandelbrot and Julia sets viewer that will provide
*full information* about image.

It helps you to find beautiful place and then you could use
offline tools to create high resolution and custom colored image.
